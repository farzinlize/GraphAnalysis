# Graph Analysis Script

A python script for analyzing graph diameter and drawing its degree distribution table. This project uses networkX library to determining diameter path and length of all connected components of a graph. Also it uses Plotly library to drawing degree distribution table of all components and saving them in separated HTML files.

# How to use it

1. Replace your graph CSR file names in code (nodes_vector and edges_vector) 
2. Run the script and it will generate reports include all components diameters path and length. You can find degree distribution tables in seprated HTML files at DegreeDistribution folder.
